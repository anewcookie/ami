## USER FEEDBACK
[User Feedback Summary](https://github.com/anewcookie/ami/blob/master/user_popularity.md "User Feedback")

## KNOWN ISSUES
1. There is no way for users to delete inspections. The only way currently is through the admin page

## RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
1. The "Subordinates" page was never implemented. The idea behind this was to allow cadets to quickly view their subordinates AMI status and history. This could be implemented using  the already implemented Position and Inspection models.

2. It would not take much to adapt the Inspection model to support a SAMI inspection

3. Adding functionality to allow authorized cadets to delete inspections would be very useful.

4. Instead of just an image for the home page, it could show information that would be useful at a glance. Perhaps important status updates about the user's room and/or company.
